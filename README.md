## üí° Introduction
Wall of Flippers (WoF) is a Python based project designed for Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE) exploration. Its primary functionality involves the discovery of the Flipper Zero device and the identification of potential BTLE based attacks.
Please keep in mind this is a work in progress and will still continue to get updates.


## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Flipper Zero Detection (BT Must be Enabled)
- Flipper Archiving (Saving Past Data)
- Bluetooth Low Energy Attacks
  - iOS Crash and Popup BTLE Detection
  - Android Crash and Popup BTLE Detection
  - Windows Swift Pair BTLE Detection
  - LoveSpouse BTLE Detection

## üí° Future Improvements
- GoLang Support
- hcidump / hcitool support



## üìö Some Documentation


### Requirements
A few things are required to properly run WoF. One of them being a linux based operating system.
This is due to the fact that bluepy (the library used to scan for BTLE devices) requires root privileges and only supports
linux based systems. Eventually, we will start to support other operating systems. Recommended device to run WoF is a Raspberry Pi as its 
easily portable. Additionally, it's also required to have a `chipset` or a USB `adapter` that supports BTLE.

Another `requirement` is Python. Debian based install:


    $ sudo apt-get install python3

Additionally, bluepy `requires` the `libglib2.0-dev` library to be installed. Debian based install:

    $ sudo apt-get install python3-pip libglib2.0-dev

Finally, `bluepy` is required. This can be installed with the following command:

    $ sudo pip3 install bluepy

*Your install may look different depending if python3 is used*\
*Additionally, if you are having trouble. Feel free to visit this repo for better documentation: https://github.com/IanHarvey/bluepy/*



### Installation
  Alright, it's fun for the fun install process. Downloading WoF is quite straightforward as it's a few commands. 
  I'd recommend using `git` as this command can be easily used to retrieve the repository. Otherwise, just donwload via GitHub.

    $ git clone https://github.com/K3YOMI/Wall-of-Flippers

  After installing, navigate to the Wall of Flippers directory

    $ cd ./Wall\ of\ Flippers

  Next, run under `sudo` as this part is required to properly use the `pyblue` functionality.

    $ sudo python3 WallofFlippers.py

  ### Conclusion

  Tad-ah! You are now properly running WoF on your device. Hopefully this small guide works and gets you started on collecting flippers or checking for
  BTLE based attacks. Feel free to report bugs as this can help improve WoF. You can modify, release, or use Wall of Flippers in any way you want
  as long as proper credit is given to `emilia (jbohack)` and `k3yomi (kiyomi)`. Thank you!
